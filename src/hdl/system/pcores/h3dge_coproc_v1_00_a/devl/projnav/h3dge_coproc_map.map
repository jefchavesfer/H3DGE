Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   230 out of  44,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 230
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        229 out of  44,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      228 out of  44,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             194
      Number using O5 and O6:                   34
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                         1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   163 out of  11,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          312
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            82 out of     312   26%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  83 out of     312   26%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         147 out of     312   47%
    Number of unique control sets:              37
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              94 out of  44,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       485 out of     640   75%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.38
